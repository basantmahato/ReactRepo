# 🚀 ReactRepo: My Journey to Mastering React

This repository serves as a personal **playground and collection of exercises** dedicated to learning and practicing the core concepts of the React JavaScript library. It documents my progress, experiments with new features, and showcases foundational React projects.

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

The primary objective of this repository is to gain practical mastery over the following key React and related concepts:

* **Core Concepts:** Components, Props, State, and the Component Lifecycle.
* **Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and custom Hooks.
* **State Management:** Implementing robust state handling, initially with Context API/Redux Toolkit (or similar).
* **Routing:** Mastering client-side navigation using **React Router DOM**.
* **Styling:** Exploring modern styling solutions (e.g., Styled Components, Tailwind CSS).
* **API Integration:** Fetching and managing data from external APIs using modern practices (e.g., `async/await`, React Query).

## 📁 Project Structure

The code is organized into separate folders, each focusing on a specific concept or micro-project.

| Folder | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01-basics` | Simple components, JSX syntax, and prop drilling exercises. | ✅ Completed |
| `02-hooks` | Dedicated examples for each built-in React Hook. | 🚧 In Progress |
| `03-router-app` | A small, multi-page application demonstrating routing. | 💡 Planning |
| `04-state-mgt` | Experiments with Redux/Context API for global state. | 💡 Planning |
| `[Add your next folder]` | Description of the next learning module. | 💡 Planning/🚧 In Progress |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React:** The core JavaScript library.
* **[Tool]:** **Vite** or **Create React App (CRA)** for scaffolding.
* **JavaScript:** ES6+ features.
* **[Styling]:** CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (or your preferred styling).

## 🏃 Getting Started

To explore the code and run the examples locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) and **npm** or **yarn** installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/basantmahato/ReactRepo.git](https://github.com/basantmahato/ReactRepo.git)
    cd ReactRepo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the application/examples:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

The application should open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📝 Usage

Navigate through the source code (`src/` folder) to find the individual component files and logic for each learning module. Each folder is designed to be self-contained for easy review.
